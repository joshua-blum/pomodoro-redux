The concept behind the Pomodoro technique is to take short breaks between manageable periods of focus to increae productivity.

## Functionality

A user may customize the length of the breaks that they take, as well as the length of their focus time. The default values for focus time and break time are set to 25 minutes and 5 minutes, respectively.

A user may press the "Play" button to start their session, and the "Stop" button to end their session. While the session is active, the "Play" button becomes a "Pause" button, which will allow the user to pause their timer.
